description: Workflow for implementing features and ensuring quality
---

1. **Plan & Implementation**
   - Create or update a plan in `plans/`.
   - Implement the feature code.

2. **Testing**
   - Run relevant unit tests.
   - Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions.
   - // turbo
   - npm test
   - *Requirement:* All tests must pass before completion.

3. **Documentation**
   - Update `README.md` with new features, architecture changes, or setup instructions.
   - Update the implementation plan to reflect the current state (or mark as complete).
   - *Requirement:* Documentation must be kept in sync with code changes.
